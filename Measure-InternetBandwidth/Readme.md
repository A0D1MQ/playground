# Measure-InternetBandwidth

Measure your internet bandwidth

Example:

*Please note I'm using an alias here*

Please notice I'm using http://speedtest.tele2.net services, so if you're outside of Europe you should probably change it to the ones local to you.

This test also fails for speeds exceeding the file size per second which in my example is 10MB.

Speedtests are never an absolute measure for your internet bandwidth
